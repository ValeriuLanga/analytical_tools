(Readme WIP)

This is a repo used mostly to explore and expand on concepts learned from Python for Finance. 
* models.py - explores a few ideas such as using lagging returns as input data for model training
  * the models module contains classes that help streamline the actual running of the models
* correlation_signal.py - aims to find some correlation between different cryptos
* correlation_heatmap.py - shows a heatmap for the returns of different cryptos (similar goal to above)
* simple_data_visualization.py - allows an easier way to explore different market data points for a selection of cryptos
* data_sourcing - a module used to load market data from Coinbase and [EOD](https://eodhd.com/) - both require an api key to access
